## Customization

Want to change the text? Everything—the text, images, and even the jokes—can be customized in the file [`src/config.ts`](src/config.ts). Check out what's there:

```ts
import { assets } from "$app/paths";

export const config = {
	mainPage: {
		heading: "Hello, Anna",
		invitation: "Will you go on a date with me this week? 👉👈🥺",
		yesText: "Yes",
		noText: "No",
		topImage: `${assets}/Assets/Top_picture/Cute_pic2.jpg`,
		leftHeart: `${assets}/Assets/Hearts/heart_3d.gif`,
		rightHeart: `${assets}/Assets/Hearts/heart_3d.gif`,
	},
	noPage: {
		message: '"No" – is not an option at all😁',
		image: `${assets}/Assets/No_picture/kermit-shooting.gif`,
	},
	yesPage: {
		message: "See you this week 😄",
		image: `${assets}/Assets/Yes_picture/Yes.gif`,
	},
};
```

## Technological Magic

This site is powered by the force of technology:
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev):** Builds interfaces faster than a GPT query for React.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev):** Because who doesn’t love a server that starts up faster than a new lame joke from Reddit climbs the r/memes.
